Active Surf Tracking Cam

## prototyping steps
* Testing the range of a simple GPS radio arrangement
* evaluate zoom autofocus lens for raspberry pi camera
* test with Dockstaring at Tiefenbrunnen (did you mean DockstarTing?)

## technical challenges
* ground-to-ground radio performance issue
* Varying orientation and placement of the transmitting antenna

## "Advisory Board"
* telemetric gps module, baud rate 4'800 should be enough
* Select a weaker hardware zoom level and refine the image section using software (computer vision).
